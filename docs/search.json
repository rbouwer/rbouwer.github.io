After working as a data engineer, I had the foundation in handling large datasets and architecting robust data pipelines. I found the 10-month professional data science master’s program to seamlessly complement my experience in data engineering and background in mathematics. Thus far, I have acquired new proficiency in statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, enabling me to extract patterns and make predictions. I value how the program, given my background, has not only equipped me with numerous technical data science skills but also nurtured my analytical thinking abilities.\n\nKey Courses\n\nMachine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised; Classification, Regression, Neural Networks, Language Modelling (NLP), Feature Selection, Time Series & Temporal Models, Deep Learning)\nStatistics (Predictive & Descriptive Statistical Inference, A/B Testing, Hypothesis Testing, Bayesian Statistics, Regression)\nRelational Databases & Database Management (PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB)\nData Visualization (Python: Altair & matlplotlib, R: ggplot)\nML Ops & Software Development (CI/CD, Containerization, Reproducibility, Data Science Workflows, Unit Testing, Automated Workflows)\nWeb & Cloud Computing (AWS, Spark)\nData Structures & Algorithms\nData Privacy & Ethics"
