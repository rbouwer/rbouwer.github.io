After working as a data engineer, I had the foundation in handling large datasets and architecting robust data pipelines. The program is a 10-month professional master’s program in Data Science that I found to build perfectly on my data engineering experience and background in mathematics. So far, I have gained new tools in statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for extracting patterns and making predictions. Given my background, I appreciate that the program has not only provided me (so many) technical skills but has also fostered my analytical thinking skills.\n\nKey Courses\n\nMachine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised; Classification, Regression, Neural Networks, Language Modelling (NLP), Feature Selection, Time Series & Temporal Models, Deep Learning)\nStatistics (Predictive & Descriptive Statistical Inference, A/B Testing, Hypothesis Testing, Bayesian Statistics, Regression),\nRelational Databases & Database Management (PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB)\nData Visualization (Python: Altair & matlplotlib, R: ggplot)\nML Ops & Software Development (CI/CD, Containerization, Reproducibility, Data Science Workflows, Unit Testing, Automated Workflows)\nWeb & Cloud Computing (AWS, Spark)\nData Structures & Algorithms\nData Privacy & Ethics"
